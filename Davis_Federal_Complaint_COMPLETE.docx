VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

COMES NOW Plaintiff Jeffrey M. Davis, Jr., by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against Defendants alleges as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This is a civil rights action seeking compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory relief, and permanent injunctive relief for violations of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd), the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.), the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794), state medical malpractice law, state negligence law, and state intentional tort law.

2. Between November 1-3, 2025, Plaintiff Jeffrey M. Davis, Jr. presented to Meriter Hospital's emergency department four times in 72 hours with acute suicidal ideation and self-inflicted injuries, was discharged three times without psychiatric stabilization, and attempted suicide three times—exactly as Defendant Journey Mental Health had predicted would happen in a sworn court filing five months earlier.

3. This complaint documents a 23-year pattern of systemic violations spanning from 2001-2002 (when Plaintiff was 17-18 years old) through November 27, 2025 (two days before this filing), demonstrating that these violations are not isolated incidents but rather the predictable result of unconstitutional policies, customs, and practices.

4. The evidence proves Defendants' actual knowledge, deliberate indifference, and conscious disregard for Plaintiff's constitutional rights and federal statutory protections, including: (a) Journey's June 2025 sworn court evaluation predicting the exact pattern that occurred; (b) Dr. Rahnema's documented statement "I do not feel comfortable sending patient back to jail" before discharging Plaintiff to jail anyway; (c) Wellpath's denial of court-ordered psychiatric medications in violation of a $38.7 million contract; (d) Meriter's ASA 3 classification on September 3, 2025, formally documenting Plaintiff's severe systemic disease and instability; and (e) continuation of the same failures on November 27, 2025, proving systemic deficiencies remain uncorrected.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff's federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction), 28 U.S.C. § 1343 (civil rights jurisdiction), and 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(2)(A) (EMTALA private right of action).

6. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), as those claims form part of the same case or controversy as Plaintiff's federal claims.

7. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in this District, and because Defendants reside or have principal places of business in this District.

PARTIES

8. Plaintiff Jeffrey M. Davis, Jr. is a 41-year-old individual who resides in Madison, Dane County, Wisconsin.

9. Plaintiff has been diagnosed with serious mental illnesses including Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

10. Plaintiff's serious mental illnesses constitute disabilities within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1), and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B).

11. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Plaintiff was subject to a Chapter 51 court-ordered commitment requiring psychiatric treatment and medication compliance.

12. Defendant Journey Mental Health, Inc. ("Journey") is a Wisconsin nonprofit corporation with its principal place of business in Madison, Dane County, Wisconsin.

13. Journey operates as Dane County's designated mental health crisis intervention agency and receives federal funding, including Medicaid reimbursements.

14. Journey provides crisis mental health services to individuals experiencing psychiatric emergencies, including individuals in custody and at hospital emergency departments.

15. Defendant Meriter Hospital, Inc. d/b/a UnityPoint Health-Meriter ("Meriter") is a Wisconsin nonprofit corporation operating an acute care hospital with an emergency department located at 202 South Park Street, Madison, Dane County, Wisconsin.

16. Meriter participates in Medicare and is therefore bound by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd.

17. Defendant Sami Rahnema, M.D. is a physician licensed to practice medicine in Wisconsin who was, at all times relevant to this Complaint, employed by or working under contract with Meriter Hospital.

18. Dr. Rahnema personally examined and treated Plaintiff during Plaintiff's November 2, 2025 emergency department visit at approximately 1:20 a.m. to 2:08 a.m.

19. Defendant Dane County, Wisconsin ("Dane County") is a municipal entity organized under the laws of the State of Wisconsin.

20. Dane County operates the Dane County Jail and contracts for healthcare services at the jail.

21. Defendant Wellpath Healthcare Corporation ("Wellpath") is a Delaware corporation doing business in Wisconsin.

22. Wellpath contracts with Dane County to provide healthcare services at the Dane County Jail pursuant to a contract executed January 1, 2023, with a term through December 31, 2027, for total consideration of $38,732,469.

24. Plaintiff will seek leave to amend this Complaint to identify Defendants John/Jane Does 1-20 by their true names when those identities become known.

HISTORICAL PATTERN: 2001-2002 INCIDENT

25. The systemic violations documented in this Complaint extend back at least 23 years to when Plaintiff was 17-18 years old.

26. In approximately 2001 or 2002, Plaintiff was incarcerated at the Dane County Jail.

27. Dane County Jail deputies placed Plaintiff in a cell that was covered in another inmate's feces.

28. When Plaintiff complained, a deputy told him to clean it himself.

29. In response to these dehumanizing conditions, Plaintiff drank cleaning solution in a suicide attempt.

30. Plaintiff was transported to a hospital, believed to be Meriter Hospital.

31. The hospital did not adequately evaluate or stabilize Plaintiff's psychiatric emergency.

32. The hospital returned Plaintiff to the Dane County Jail without proper psychiatric stabilization.

33. Upon return to the jail, Plaintiff engaged in additional self-destructive behavior.

34. This 2001-2002 incident demonstrates the same pattern that would repeat for the next 23 years: (a) Plaintiff experiences suicidal crisis while in custody; (b) Plaintiff is taken to hospital emergency department; (c) hospital fails to adequately evaluate and stabilize; (d) hospital returns Plaintiff to custody despite ongoing psychiatric emergency; (e) Plaintiff engages in additional self-harm.

35. The fact that this exact pattern has repeated over 23 years proves these are not isolated incidents but rather the predictable result of systemic policies, customs, and practices.

36. Medical records from 2001-2002 may not be available due to records retention limitations.

37. However, the existence of this historical incident is known to Plaintiff and establishes the decades-long pattern of constitutional violations.

38. This historical pattern is relevant to proving Defendants' deliberate indifference and the need for injunctive relief to prevent future violations.

NOVEMBER 2024 WELLPATH CONTRACT VIOLATIONS

39. In November 2024, Plaintiff was again incarcerated at the Dane County Jail under a Chapter 51 court-ordered commitment.

40. The July 2025 Chapter 51 recommitment order (which renewed the earlier commitment) specified that Plaintiff was required to take four psychiatric medications:
    a. Bupropion HCl 300 mg (antidepressant);
    b. Clonidine HCl 0.1 mg (anti-hypertensive used for psychiatric symptoms);
    c. Lithium Carbonate ER 900 mg (mood stabilizer);
    d. Loxapine Succinate 25 mg PRN (antipsychotic for acute symptoms).

41. These four medications were court-ordered as a condition of Plaintiff's commitment and were medically necessary to treat Plaintiff's serious mental illnesses.

42. Upon information and belief, the November 2024 commitment order contained the same or substantially similar medication requirements.

43. When Plaintiff arrived at the Dane County Jail in November 2024, Wellpath Healthcare staff were responsible for providing his court-ordered psychiatric medications.

44. Wellpath nurse John Doe #14 explicitly refused to provide Plaintiff's court-ordered psychiatric medications.

45. When Plaintiff requested his medications, John Doe #14 told him he would have to wait for "an opening in the prescriber's schedule."

46. Wellpath's refusal to provide court-ordered medications was a direct violation of the Wellpath-Dane County contract.

47. Section 40(n) of the Wellpath-Dane County contract states: "Medications for life-threatening or mental illnesses, or serious chronic diseases, shall not be delayed upon admission. All efforts shall be made to verify and dispense these medications prior to the next scheduled dose once the medical staff is aware, and within 24 hours for all other medications."

48. Plaintiff's psychiatric medications fall squarely within the category of "medications for... mental illnesses" that "shall not be delayed upon admission."

49. Section 40(g) of the Wellpath-Dane County contract requires the Medical Director to approve or deny non-formulary requests including psychotropic medications.

50. No Medical Director review was conducted or documented regarding Plaintiff's court-ordered psychiatric medications.

51. Section 31(c) of the Wellpath-Dane County contract requires that residents on psychotropic medications or with a history of mental illness receive a complete evaluation by qualified mental health personnel within 24-72 hours of intake.

52. No mental health evaluation was conducted within 24-72 hours of Plaintiff's November 2024 intake despite his Chapter 51 commitment status and psychiatric medication requirements.

53. Wellpath made no effort to verify Plaintiff's court order requiring these medications.

54. Wellpath made no effort to use a backup pharmacy to obtain these medications.

55. Wellpath made no effort to contact Plaintiff's treating psychiatrist to coordinate care.

56. As a direct and proximate result of Wellpath's denial of court-ordered psychiatric medications, Plaintiff went without his psychiatric medications for multiple days.

57. Meriter Hospital medical records from November 2025 document that Plaintiff had been off his medications for "multiple days," confirming Wellpath's medication denial. (Winnebago Record, p. 170).

58. The denial of court-ordered psychiatric medications caused Plaintiff's mental health to rapidly deteriorate.

59. Without his medications, Plaintiff experienced worsening depression, suicidal ideation, and emotional dysregulation.

60. While off medications and psychiatrically unstable at the Dane County Jail in November 2024, Plaintiff attempted suicide three times.

61. These three suicide attempts in November 2024 were the direct and foreseeable result of Wellpath's denial of court-ordered psychiatric medications in violation of its contractual obligations.

62. Wellpath's denial of medications also violated Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment rights to adequate medical care while in custody.

63. Wellpath's actions demonstrated deliberate indifference to Plaintiff's serious medical needs.

PRE-NOVEMBER 2025 CONTEXT

64. On September 3, 2025, Plaintiff underwent a medical procedure at Meriter Hospital requiring anesthesia.

65. Meriter's own anesthesiologist formally classified Plaintiff as ASA Physical Status Classification 3 (ASA 3).

66. The ASA Physical Status Classification System is a nationally recognized standard used by anesthesiologists to assess patient health status before anesthesia.

67. ASA 3 classification is defined as: "A patient with severe systemic disease."

68. The anesthesiologist's ASA 3 classification specifically documented Plaintiff's severe systemic diseases including: depression, PTSD, polysubstance use disorder, ulcerative esophagitis, anemia, and vocal fold paralysis.

69. The ASA 3 classification constitutes Meriter's own internal admission that Plaintiff had severe systemic disease requiring careful medical monitoring and treatment.

70. The ASA 3 classification directly contradicts any subsequent claim by Meriter that Plaintiff was "stable" at discharge during the November 2025 incidents.

71. Meriter's institutional records thus prove Plaintiff's instability and need for comprehensive medical and psychiatric treatment.

72. In October 2025, Plaintiff was subject to a Chapter 51 recommitment order requiring psychiatric treatment and medication compliance.

73. This court order was a standing judicial mandate that Plaintiff receive and comply with psychiatric treatment.

74. Any discharge decision by Meriter had to respect this mandated psychiatric stabilization requirement.

75. Failure to stabilize Plaintiff before discharge violated not only EMTALA and constitutional standards but also disregarded a direct court order.

76. Meriter Hospital has extensive documented history with Plaintiff spanning from 2020 through 2025, including multiple presentations for suicidal ideation and psychiatric emergencies.

77. This history put Meriter on notice of Plaintiff's psychiatric risk profile and EMTALA obligations when treating him.

JOURNEY'S JUNE 2025 SWORN PREDICTION

78. On June 12, 2025, Defendant Journey Mental Health filed a sworn court document in Dane County Circuit Court Case No. 2025CF000XXX (exact case number to be provided through discovery).

79. This court document was filed in connection with Plaintiff's Chapter 51 commitment proceedings.

80. Journey's sworn evaluation, signed by Journey staff under penalty of perjury, stated: "Jeff's depression can worsen very quickly once isolated."

81. Journey further stated: "These behaviors are consistent with his last very serious attempt."

82. Journey concluded: "Jeff is at great risk of suicide if not under a commitment."

83. This June 2025 evaluation constitutes Journey's documented institutional knowledge that: (a) Plaintiff's depression worsens quickly when isolated; (b) Plaintiff has a pattern of serious suicide attempts; (c) Plaintiff is at great risk of suicide without intensive intervention.

84. Journey's sworn prediction would prove tragically accurate five months later.

85. Journey's June 2025 evaluation establishes actual knowledge of the substantial risk of serious harm to Plaintiff.

86. This knowledge is imputed to all Journey employees, including crisis workers "George," "Kathy," and "Heidi."

87. Journey's subsequent failures to evaluate and stabilize Plaintiff in November 2025 occurred with full knowledge of these documented risks.

NOVEMBER 1, 2025 - FIRST MERITER VISIT

88. On November 1, 2025, at approximately 10:42 a.m., Plaintiff was not taking his court-ordered psychiatric medications.

89. Plaintiff was experiencing acute psychiatric distress and suicidal ideation.

90. Law enforcement officers encountered Plaintiff and pointed firearms at him.

91. An officer stated to Plaintiff: "I'll fucking shoot you."

92. Plaintiff, in the throes of suicidal crisis, responded: "Do it!"

93. This exchange constituted what is colloquially known as "suicide by cop" - an attempt to provoke law enforcement into using lethal force.

94. Officers arrested Plaintiff instead of shooting him.

95. Officers transported Plaintiff to Meriter Hospital Emergency Department for psychiatric evaluation under Chapter 51.

96. Plaintiff arrived at Meriter Emergency Department acutely suicidal, off his court-ordered medications, and having just attempted suicide by cop.

97. These facts established an "emergency medical condition" as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e)(1).

98. Meriter was obligated under EMTALA to provide an "appropriate medical screening examination" to determine whether an emergency medical condition existed. 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a).

99. Meriter was further obligated to stabilize any emergency medical condition before discharge. 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b)(1).

100. Journey Mental Health crisis workers were contacted to perform psychiatric evaluation for possible Chapter 51 return to more restrictive setting.

101. Journey crisis worker "Kathy" (Jane Doe #2) initiated paperwork for Chapter 51 return to psychiatric facility.

102. After beginning the return process, Journey reported that they had "lost the paperwork."

103. Journey then cancelled the Chapter 51 return without completing psychiatric evaluation.

104. Journey's cancellation of the return was not based on clinical assessment that Plaintiff was stabilized.

105. Journey cancelled because they claimed to have lost paperwork - an administrative failure, not a clinical determination.

106. Meriter Emergency Department conducted only limited assessment without comprehensive psychiatric evaluation.

107. Meriter failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination as required by EMTALA.

108. Meriter failed to engage adequate crisis resources despite Plaintiff's known psychiatric risk.

109. Meriter discharged Plaintiff without psychiatric stabilization.

110. Meriter discharged Plaintiff back to Dane County Jail despite: (a) acute suicidal ideation; (b) suicide by cop attempt hours earlier; (c) being off court-ordered medications; (d) Journey's documented knowledge that isolation worsens Plaintiff's condition; (e) no completed psychiatric evaluation.

111. Meriter provided no safe discharge plan.

112. Meriter made no arrangement for medication restart.

113. Meriter made no arrangement for psychiatric follow-up.

114. Upon arrival at Dane County Jail, Plaintiff was placed on suicide observation status.

115. Dane County Jail staff were aware Plaintiff was acutely suicidal.

116. Plaintiff was not properly monitored despite suicide observation status.

117. Plaintiff's threats of suicide were dismissed and ignored by jail staff.

118. Later on November 1, 2025, while on suicide observation status at Dane County Jail, Plaintiff attempted suicide for the first time by cutting himself. (SUICIDE ATTEMPT #1)

119. This first suicide attempt occurred in the same dangerous conditions to which Meriter had just discharged Plaintiff.

120. This first suicide attempt proved that Meriter's discharge was premature and that Plaintiff was not stabilized.

121. The first suicide attempt was the direct and foreseeable result of Meriter's failure to stabilize under EMTALA.

NOVEMBER 1-2, 2025 - SECOND MERITER VISIT

122. Following Suicide Attempt #1, Plaintiff was transported back to Meriter Hospital Emergency Department.

123. This return to the emergency department within hours of discharge proved material deterioration of Plaintiff's psychiatric condition.

124. Material deterioration after discharge is strong evidence that the patient was not stabilized before the initial discharge.

125. Plaintiff presented with self-inflicted lacerations from Suicide Attempt #1.

126. Plaintiff's psychiatric symptoms had worsened since the first discharge hours earlier.

127. Plaintiff explicitly told Meriter staff to send him back to jail so he could kill himself.

128. This statement constituted express suicidal intent and plan.

129. Plaintiff refused medical treatment for his lacerations.

130. Plaintiff refused psychiatric treatment.

131. Plaintiff's refusal of treatment while expressing intent to kill himself demonstrated severely impaired judgment and acute psychiatric emergency.

132. Journey Mental Health was again contacted for crisis evaluation.

133. Journey again refused to perform comprehensive psychiatric evaluation.

134. Meriter did not provide sutures for Plaintiff's lacerations during this second visit.

135. Meriter did not provide psychiatric stabilization.

136. Meriter did not arrange medication restart despite knowing Plaintiff was off court-ordered medications.

137. Meriter discharged Plaintiff back to Dane County Jail for the second time in approximately 12-18 hours.

138. Meriter discharged Plaintiff despite: (a) recent suicide attempt hours earlier; (b) new self-inflicted injuries; (c) express statement of intent to return to jail to kill himself; (d) refusal of treatment indicating impaired judgment; (e) worsening psychiatric condition since first discharge; (f) Journey's refusal to evaluate.

139. This second discharge violated EMTALA's stabilization requirement.

140. This second discharge demonstrated deliberate indifference to serious risk of harm.

141. Within hours of this second discharge, Plaintiff ripped open his wound, constituting Suicide Attempt #2.

NOVEMBER 2, 2025 (EARLY MORNING) - THIRD MERITER VISIT

142. Following Suicide Attempt #2, Plaintiff was transported to Meriter Hospital Emergency Department for the third time in approximately 24 hours.

143. Plaintiff now presented with lacerations that had been ripped open in a second suicide attempt.

144. Plaintiff required sutures.

145. Plaintiff was treated by Dr. Sami Rahnema from approximately 1:20 a.m. to 2:08 a.m. on November 2, 2025.

146. Dr. Rahnema documented in Plaintiff's medical chart: "I do not feel comfortable sending patient back to jail."

147. This statement proves Dr. Rahnema's actual knowledge that Plaintiff was not stabilized.

148. This statement proves Dr. Rahnema's actual knowledge that discharge to jail posed serious risk of harm.

149. This statement proves Dr. Rahnema's actual awareness that he was violating medical standards by discharging Plaintiff.

150. Despite documenting his discomfort with the discharge, Dr. Rahnema discharged Plaintiff to jail anyway.

151. Journey Mental Health was contacted for crisis evaluation.

152. Journey crisis worker "George" (John Doe #1) responded.

153. George refused to perform psychiatric evaluation of Plaintiff.

154. George instructed Meriter Emergency Department staff to "sedate and suture" Plaintiff and send him back to jail.

155. George's instruction to "sedate" Plaintiff without consent would constitute assault and battery.

156. George's instruction to "sedate and suture" without psychiatric evaluation violated professional standards for crisis intervention.

157. George stated he did not want to "reward his behaviors" with psychiatric hospitalization.

158. This statement proves George's decision was based on punitive reasoning, not clinical assessment.

159. This statement proves Journey's policy of refusing evaluation based on behavioral judgments rather than medical necessity.

160. Dr. Rahnema recognized that sedating Plaintiff without consent would violate legal and ethical standards.

161. However, Dr. Rahnema also failed to secure adequate psychiatric evaluation through alternative means.

162. Dr. Rahnema did not contact a different crisis agency.

163. Dr. Rahnema did not arrange for inpatient psychiatric admission through other channels.

164. Dr. Rahnema did not arrange for medication restart.

165. Dr. Rahnema did not create a safety plan.

166. Meriter social work staff reported they had "lost the ED documentation and paperwork."

167. This loss of documentation constituted breakdown in continuity of care.

168. This loss of documentation undermined safe treatment and discharge decisions.

169. Despite lost documentation, documented physician concern, two prior suicide attempts, Journey's refusal to evaluate, and express suicidal statements, Dr. Rahnema discharged Plaintiff back to Dane County Jail.

170. Dr. Rahnema sutured Plaintiff's lacerations but provided no psychiatric stabilization.

171. Dr. Rahnema's discharge instructions consisted only of verbal instructions to follow up with primary care physician and return precautions.

172. These minimal instructions were wholly inadequate for a patient who had attempted suicide twice in 24 hours.

173. Plaintiff was returned to the exact same cell at Dane County Jail where he had attempted suicide twice.

174. No additional safety measures were implemented at the jail.

175. Plaintiff remained off his court-ordered psychiatric medications.

176. Plaintiff continued to express suicidal intent.

177. This third discharge constituted knowing and willful violation of EMTALA.

178. Dr. Rahnema's documented statement "I do not feel comfortable" proves he knowingly violated EMTALA's stabilization requirement.

179. A knowing and willful EMTALA violation subjects the physician to civil monetary penalties up to $119,942 per violation. 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. § 1003.103(a); 89 Fed. Reg. 41,638 (May 10, 2024).

180. Meriter Hospital's institutional knowledge of the risk is proven by: (a) Dr. Rahnema's documented concern; (b) social work's involvement and lost paperwork; (c) three presentations in 24 hours; (d) two documented suicide attempts.

NOVEMBER 2, 2025 (EVENING) - FOURTH MERITER VISIT

181. On the evening of November 2, 2025, approximately 16-18 hours after the third discharge, Plaintiff required return to Meriter Emergency Department for suture care.

182. This fourth visit provided another opportunity for psychiatric evaluation and stabilization.

183. Dr. Rahnema again evaluated Plaintiff.

184. Plaintiff again presented with positive suicide screening showing suicidal thoughts and vague intent.

185. Journey Mental Health was again contacted.

186. Journey again refused to provide adequate psychiatric evaluation.

187. Meriter again discharged Plaintiff without stabilization despite: (a) three prior discharges in 48 hours; (b) two documented suicide attempts; (c) ongoing suicidal ideation; (d) positive suicide screening; (e) being off medications; (f) same dangerous jail conditions awaiting him.

188. Meriter made no arrangement for psychiatric hospitalization.

189. Meriter made no arrangement for medication restart.

190. Meriter made no arrangement for intensive outpatient services.

191. This fourth discharge was medically indefensible.

192. Plaintiff was returned to the same cell at Dane County Jail where he had already attempted suicide twice.

NOVEMBER 3, 2025 - THIRD SUICIDE ATTEMPT

193. On November 3, 2025, approximately 17 hours after his fourth discharge from Meriter, Plaintiff attempted suicide for the third time by cutting himself with a piece of concrete. (SUICIDE ATTEMPT #3)

194. This third suicide attempt occurred while Plaintiff was on suicide observation status at Dane County Jail.

195. This third suicide attempt occurred in the same cell where he had made two prior attempts.

196. This third suicide attempt occurred under the same dangerous conditions to which Meriter had discharged him four times.

197. This third suicide attempt proves Meriter's four discharges violated EMTALA's stabilization requirement.

198. This third suicide attempt was entirely foreseeable based on: (a) Journey's June 2025 prediction; (b) two prior attempts after prior discharges; (c) documented ongoing suicidal ideation; (d) same dangerous conditions; (e) denial of medications.

199. Following this third suicide attempt, Plaintiff was transported to Meriter Emergency Department for a fifth time.

200. Only after this third suicide attempt did Journey Mental Health finally agree to perform comprehensive crisis evaluation.

201. Only after this third suicide attempt did Journey agree to effectuate Chapter 51 return to more restrictive setting.

202. Journey's crisis evaluator determined Plaintiff required immediate inpatient psychiatric hospitalization.

203. This determination proves Plaintiff had required inpatient hospitalization during all four prior emergency department visits.

204. Plaintiff was transferred to Winnebago Mental Health Institute on November 4, 2025, at approximately 1:59 a.m.

WINNEBAGO STABILIZATION - PROVING STABILIZATION WAS POSSIBLE

205. Plaintiff's admission to Winnebago Mental Health Institute proves psychiatric stabilization was possible and should have occurred at Meriter.

206. At Winnebago, Plaintiff's court-ordered psychiatric medications were immediately restarted:
     a. Bupropion (Wellbutrin XL) 300 mg daily;
     b. Lithium 900 mg daily;
     c. Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) 60 mg daily.

207. Plaintiff also received omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for his documented gastric ulcer, enabling him to tolerate psychiatric medications.

208. This medication coordination was a foreseeable need that Meriter could and should have addressed at discharge.

209. Meriter's failure to coordinate medication restart strengthened the causal chain leading to suicide attempts.

210. With psychiatric medications restarted and comprehensive treatment initiated, Plaintiff's acute suicidality resolved.

211. Winnebago medical records document Plaintiff's progress:
     a. November 4, 2025 (admission): Suicidal ideation, recent suicide attempts, acute distress;
     b. November 5, 2025: Mood improving, denies current suicidal ideation;
     c. November 6, 2025: Continued improvement, attending groups, compliant with treatment;
     d. November 7, 2025: One incident of agitation regarding wound care, but no self-harm;
     e. November 10, 2025 (discharge): No suicidal ideation, committed to safety, medication compliant.

212. Plaintiff was discharged from Winnebago on November 10, 2025, after 7 days of treatment.

213. Winnebago discharge summary documents: "Denies suicidal or homicidal ideation upon discharge discussions."

214. Winnebago discharge summary further documents Plaintiff's "future based thinking by discussing his plans to return home, resume employment, repair of damaged relationships."

215. The contrast between Plaintiff's condition at Meriter (repeated suicide attempts) and at Winnebago (stabilized in 7 days) proves causation.

216. When proper psychiatric stabilization occurred, the psychiatric emergency resolved.

217. When Meriter discharged without stabilization, harm continued.

218. This contrast definitively proves Meriter's EMTALA violations caused Plaintiff's suicide attempts.

NOVEMBER 27, 2025 - CONTINUING SYSTEMIC VIOLATIONS

219. On November 27, 2025, just two days before filing this Complaint, the same systemic failures continued.

220. At 6:58 PM, Plaintiff sent a text message to Journey Mental Health Crisis Line stating: "Is someone available to talk that is competent and won't provoke me?"

221. At 6:58 PM, Journey sent an automated response directing Plaintiff to call the crisis line.

222. At 6:59 PM, Plaintiff responded: "?"

223. At 7:01 PM, Journey responded: "Jeff, someone will call you shortly."

224. At 7:01 PM, Plaintiff asked: "Who?"

225. At 7:02 PM, Journey responded: "Heidi will be calling you, one of our crisis workers."

226. At 7:02 PM, Plaintiff responded: "If they're new, George, insensitive, etc, I'd rather not."

227. Plaintiff's reference to "George" demonstrates Plaintiff's awareness that George had failed to provide adequate crisis services during the November 2025 incidents.

228. At approximately 7:04 PM, crisis worker "Heidi" (Jane Doe #3) called Plaintiff.

229. The telephone call lasted approximately 7 minutes.

230. During the call, Plaintiff mentioned not wanting to talk to George due to prior negative experiences.

231. Heidi characterized George as "old school" and "stern."

232. Heidi's characterization of George constitutes Journey's institutional admission that George's approach is problematic.

233. Heidi's characterization proves Journey is aware George's "old school" and "stern" approach is inconsistent with trauma-informed crisis intervention.

234. Despite this knowledge, Journey continues to employ George as a crisis worker.

235. A 7-minute telephone call is grossly inadequate for proper suicide risk assessment.

236. Standard suicide risk assessment requires 20-45 minutes of clinical interview.

237. Heidi did not review Plaintiff's file before calling.

238. Heidi did not ask about Plaintiff's Chapter 51 commitment status.

239. Heidi did not ask about Plaintiff's medication compliance.

240. Heidi did not conduct comprehensive suicide risk assessment using validated instruments such as the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.

241. The November 27, 2025 incident occurred exactly one year after the November 2024 medication denial incidents.

242. The November 27, 2025 incident occurred 24 days after the November 1-3, 2025 four-visit, three-attempt crisis.

243. Despite these recent crises, Journey has made no meaningful changes to its policies, customs, or practices.

244. The November 27, 2025 incident proves Journey's systemic deficiencies remain uncorrected.

245. The November 27, 2025 incident demonstrates different worker (Heidi vs. George/Kathy), same failures.

246. This pattern defeats any "isolated incident" defense.

247. This pattern proves the need for injunctive relief to prevent future violations.

MERITER'S 15-YEAR PATTERN OF DOCUMENTED HIGH-RISK DISCHARGES

248. Plaintiff's November 2025 crisis was not an isolated incident but rather part of a 15-year pattern of Meriter discharging Plaintiff despite high suicide risk.

249. On January 4, 2020, Plaintiff presented to Meriter Emergency Department with psychiatric crisis and suicidal ideation.

250. Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) screening documented HIGH RISK with "Yes" responses to: suicidal thoughts, intent, plan, and past attempts.

251. Despite this high-risk screen, Meriter discharged Plaintiff without psychiatric stabilization.

252. On October 4, 2020, Plaintiff presented to Meriter Emergency Department with suicidal ideation and plan.

253. C-SSRS screening documented HIGH RISK with Columbia score of 6 and "Yes" responses to: current suicidal thoughts, plan, and intent.

254. Despite Columbia score of 6 indicating severe suicide risk, Meriter discharged Plaintiff without psychiatric stabilization.

255. On March 23, 2021, Plaintiff presented to Meriter Emergency Department with suicidal ideation and depression.

256. C-SSRS screening documented HIGH RISK with "Yes" responses to: intent, plan, and past attempts.

257. Meriter documented suicide precautions but nonetheless discharged Plaintiff without psychiatric stabilization.

258. On August 23, 2021, Plaintiff presented to Meriter Emergency Department with depression, anxiety, and hopelessness.

259. Mental health concerns were documented but Columbia screening was not visible in records.

260. Meriter discharged Plaintiff after brief evaluation without psychiatric stabilization.

261. On January 17, 2023, Plaintiff presented to Meriter Emergency Department for behavioral health triage.

262. Columbia screening was highlighted but not detailed in available records.

263. Plaintiff was admitted to inpatient psychiatric unit after prolonged emergency department stay.

264. This January 2023 admission proves Meriter is capable of arranging psychiatric hospitalization when clinically indicated.

265. On February 17, 2023, Plaintiff presented to Meriter Emergency Department for psychiatric evaluation after returning for missing court.

266. C-SSRS screening documented LOW RISK with "No" answers to all Columbia questions.

267. This low-risk screen demonstrates that Meriter does perform Columbia screening even when suicide risk is low.

268. The contrast between February 17, 2023 (low risk, screening performed) and November 2025 (high risk, inadequate response) proves Meriter's November 2025 failures were not due to lack of screening capability.

269. On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff presented to Meriter Emergency Department for physical health evaluation.

270. No Columbia screening was visible in records; only physical risk assessments documented.

271. Routine discharge occurred.

272. This pattern from 2020-2023 put Meriter on notice of: (a) Plaintiff's recurrent suicidal ideation; (b) Plaintiff's high-risk Columbia scores; (c) the need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation before discharge.

273. Meriter's institutional knowledge of Plaintiff's psychiatric risk extends back at least 5 years before the November 2025 crisis.

274. This institutional knowledge defeats any claim that Meriter was unaware of Plaintiff's risks.

MARCH 2021 DISCHARGE: PROOF OF INSTITUTIONAL POLICY

275. The March 23, 2021 Meriter discharge is particularly significant because it documents the same rationale used to justify the November 2025 discharges.

276. On March 23, 2021, Plaintiff presented to Meriter Emergency Department with suicidal ideation and depression, resulting in high-risk Columbia screening.

277. Journey Mental Health crisis worker John Kenneally, LCSW, performed psychiatric evaluation.

278. Mr. Kenneally documented that Plaintiff "denies imminent intent or plan to hurt themselves or others."

279. However, Mr. Kenneally also documented: "It is important to note that suicidal ideations, attempts, and completions are not disorders in and of themselves. They may be manifestations of a disorder but ultimately they are choices made in thought or behavior and may not be predictable nor modifiable for the short or long term."

280. This language minimizes the significance of suicidal ideation and attempts by characterizing them as "choices" rather than symptoms of serious mental illness.

281. Mr. Kenneally further documented: "Furthermore, except when deemed to not have decision making capacity, individuals who attempt self harm or engage in violence are viewed to be accountable for their behaviors, even if said behaviors are maladaptive."

282. This language improperly places responsibility for suicide attempts on the patient rather than recognizing the need for psychiatric intervention.

283. Mr. Kenneally's assessment stated: "In a collaborative effort, the psychiatric team recognizes that suicide and violence are difficult to predict, often happen on impulse, and often happens despite the best intentions of treaters."

284. This language provides advance justification for discharging patients who subsequently attempt suicide.

285. Most significantly, Mr. Kenneally documented: "In collaborative effort and extensive discussion between several disciplines, the treatment team is deciding to discharge Jeffrey M Davis from the hospital despite ongoing endorsement of the patient of having passive suicidal ideations without expression of imminent intent and/or plan."

286. The phrase "discharge... despite ongoing endorsement of... passive suicidal ideations" proves a policy of discharging patients with ongoing suicidal ideation.

287. Mr. Kenneally listed seven "Rational[e] for this decision," including:
     a. "Patient has demonstrated sufficient signs of underlying personality pathology and poor coping skills that are not likely to fundamentally change or be modified by acute hospitalization."
     b. "Patient has history of chronic suicidal ideations and attempts and this maladaptive behavior pattern and perspective has not been substantially modified by ongoing treatment, therapy, medication adjustments, multiple and prolonged inpatient hospitalizations, or referral to appropriate outpatient services."
     c. "Patient has demonstrated repeated expressions of suicidal ideations and attempts with 'high-rescue' potential and has promptly sought emergency services."
     d. "Treatment providers have observed that patient's long standing pattern of endorsement of suicidal ideations may be attempts to garner 'negative attention' or other secondary gain by being in institutions."
     e. "Patient has exhibited tendencies or behaviors that reflect 'institutionalized' thought processes and it is believed by various disciplines that repeated hospitalizations would further propagate cycle of repeated intentions of high and exhaustive utilization of hospital services with significantly limited value in actually resulting in improvement of patient's symptoms."
     f. "Research supports that chronic suicidal ideations are best managed by outpatient care and hospitalizations offer unproven value and may even produce negative effects and undermine potential for improvement."

288. These seven rationales constitute an institutional policy of discharging patients with borderline personality disorder and chronic suicidal ideation despite ongoing suicide risk.

289. This policy is not based on individualized clinical assessment but rather on generalized assumptions about patients with personality disorders.

290. This policy violates professional standards requiring individualized suicide risk assessment.

291. This policy discriminates against individuals with borderline personality disorder by assuming they do not benefit from hospitalization.

292. The exact same rationale appears in discharge documentation from November 2025, proving this is an ongoing institutional policy spanning at least 4.5 years.

293. The March 2021 discharge note proves Meriter and Journey have a custom or policy of:
     a. Discharging patients despite ongoing suicidal ideation;
     b. Blaming "personality pathology" rather than providing treatment;
     c. Assuming hospitalization is unhelpful based on diagnosis rather than clinical need;
     d. Characterizing help-seeking behavior as "secondary gain";
     e. Using research to justify inadequate treatment;
     f. Pre-emptively disclaiming responsibility for subsequent suicide attempts.

294. This institutional policy satisfies the Monell requirement for municipal liability under § 1983.

PATTERN EVIDENCE: OTHER VICTIMS

295. Plaintiff is not the only individual harmed by these systemic violations.

296. In October-November 2023, Darreyll Thomas experienced severe mental health crisis while incarcerated at Dane County Jail.

297. Mr. Thomas had serious mental illness requiring treatment.

298. Wellpath Healthcare and Dane County Jail denied Mr. Thomas adequate mental health treatment for approximately two weeks.

299. Journey Mental Health was involved in Mr. Thomas's case.

300. Mr. Thomas filed a federal lawsuit, Thomas v. Dane County Jail, et al., Case No. 23-cv-880 (W.D. Wis. 2023).

301. The Thomas case demonstrates the same pattern of violations by the same defendants occurring in the same time period as Plaintiff's November 2024 Wellpath medication denial.

302. In approximately 2008, an inmate at Dane County Jail attempted suicide and was placed on suicide watch.

303. This inmate was transported to a hospital (believed to be Meriter) for brief evaluation.

304. The hospital returned the inmate to the jail rather than admitting to psychiatric facility.

305. This 2008 case was reported in the Capital Times newspaper.

306. This 2008 case demonstrates the same pattern that would repeat in Plaintiff's 2001-2002 case and 2025 cases.

307. The 17-year span between the 2008 case and the 2025 cases proves these are not isolated incidents.

308. Other victims of these systemic violations may exist and may be identified through discovery.

WELLPATH CONTRACT PROVISIONS

309. The Wellpath-Dane County contract is a public document governing healthcare at Dane County Jail.

310. The contract was executed effective January 1, 2023, with a term through December 31, 2027.

311. The total contract value is $38,732,469 for the five-year term.

312. Section 40(n) of the contract addresses Pharmaceutical Services and states: "Medications for life-threatening or mental illnesses, or serious chronic diseases, shall not be delayed upon admission. All efforts shall be made to verify and dispense these medications prior to the next scheduled dose once the medical staff is aware, and within 24 hours for all other medications."

313. The phrase "shall not be delayed" imposes mandatory obligation, not discretionary authority.

314. The phrase "all efforts shall be made" requires active attempts to verify and dispense medications, not passive waiting.

315. Section 40(g) of the contract states: "The Medical Director must approve/deny non-formulary requests. Such requests are frequently for psychotropic medications..."

316. This provision requires Medical Director review of psychotropic medication requests.

317. Section 31(c) of the contract states: "Residents on psychotropic medications, or those with a history of mental illness or developmental disability, shall receive a complete evaluation by qualified mental health personnel... within 24 to 72 hours of intake."

318. This provision requires mental health evaluation within 24-72 hours for individuals with mental illness history.

319. Wellpath's denial of Plaintiff's court-ordered psychiatric medications in November 2024 violated Section 40(n).

320. Wellpath made no effort to verify Plaintiff's medications with his treating providers, violating Section 40(n)'s "all efforts" requirement.

321. Wellpath made no effort to dispense medications within 24 hours, violating Section 40(n)'s timeline requirement.

322. No Medical Director review was conducted, violating Section 40(g).

323. No mental health evaluation was conducted within 24-72 hours, violating Section 31(c).

324. These contract violations constitute breach of contract against Wellpath.

325. These contract violations also constitute Fourteenth Amendment violations because they denied Plaintiff constitutionally adequate medical care while in custody.

326. Dane County is responsible for Wellpath's violations because Wellpath acts as Dane County's agent in providing healthcare at the jail.

COUNT I
42 U.S.C. § 1983 - Fourteenth Amendment Deliberate Indifference
Against Journey Mental Health, Inc. and John/Jane Does 1-3

327. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

328. Plaintiff had a clearly established constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from deliberate indifference to serious medical and psychiatric needs while in custody or during medical screening for potential custody placement.

329. Plaintiff's serious mental illnesses and acute suicidal ideation constituted serious medical needs.

330. Journey Mental Health and its employees John/Jane Does 1-3 ("George," "Kathy," and "Heidi") were aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm existed.

331. Specifically, Journey had actual knowledge of substantial risk of harm through:
     a. Journey's own June 2025 sworn court filing predicting Plaintiff was "at great risk of suicide" and that his "depression can worsen very quickly once isolated";
     b. Plaintiff's presentation with acute suicidal ideation and suicide by cop attempt on November 1, 2025;
     c. Plaintiff's first suicide attempt after first Meriter discharge;
     d. Plaintiff's second suicide attempt after second Meriter discharge;
     e. Plaintiff's express statement of intent to return to jail to kill himself;
     f. Meriter physician's repeated requests for Journey evaluation;
     g. Plaintiff's treatment history known to Journey spanning multiple years.

332. Journey and its employees drew the inference that substantial risk of serious harm existed.

333. Despite this knowledge, Journey consciously disregarded the risk by:
     a. Refusing to perform comprehensive psychiatric evaluation during November 1, 2025 visit despite suicide by cop attempt;
     b. Starting then cancelling Chapter 51 return process based on "lost paperwork" rather than clinical assessment;
     c. Refusing to perform evaluation during November 2, 2025 (1:20 a.m.) visit despite first suicide attempt;
     d. Instructing Meriter to "sedate and suture" without psychiatric evaluation;
     e. Stating refusal to evaluate was based on not wanting to "reward his behaviors";
     f. Refusing to perform adequate evaluation during November 2, 2025 (evening) visit despite two suicide attempts;
     g. Only agreeing to evaluate after third suicide attempt proved Journey's prior refusals were medically indefensible;
     h. Performing inadequate 7-minute assessment on November 27, 2025, without file review or comprehensive screening.

334. Journey's decision-making was based on punitive reasoning ("not rewarding behaviors") rather than medical necessity.

335. Journey's refusals to evaluate were not based on clinical assessment that Plaintiff was stable.

336. Journey's refusals to evaluate were based on institutional policy, custom, or practice of refusing evaluation for certain categories of patients.

337. This policy, custom, or practice treats patients with personality disorders differently from other patients with serious mental illness.

338. This policy, custom, or practice discriminates based on psychiatric diagnosis.

339. Journey's actions were objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.

340. As a direct and proximate result of Journey's deliberate indifference, Plaintiff suffered:
     a. Three suicide attempts;
     b. Multiple self-inflicted lacerations requiring sutures;
     c. Physical pain and scarring;
     d. Severe emotional distress;
     e. Prolonged psychiatric crisis lasting 72+ hours that could have been resolved with proper evaluation on November 1, 2025;
     f. Loss of liberty through continued incarceration in dangerous conditions;
     g. Violation of constitutional rights.

341. Journey's actions were willful, wanton, and in reckless disregard of Plaintiff's constitutional rights, warranting punitive damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Journey Mental Health, Inc. and John/Jane Does 1-3 for:
     a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;
     b. Punitive damages;
     c. Costs and attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988;
     d. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT II
42 U.S.C. § 1983 - Fourteenth Amendment Deliberate Indifference
Against Meriter Hospital, Inc. and Sami Rahnema, M.D.

342. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

343. Plaintiff had a clearly established constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment to receive adequate medical care when screened for potential custody placement or when returning to custody from medical treatment.

344. Plaintiff's serious mental illnesses, acute suicidal ideation, and self-inflicted injuries constituted serious medical needs.

345. Meriter Hospital and Dr. Rahnema were aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm existed.

346. Specifically, Meriter and Dr. Rahnema had actual knowledge through:
     a. Dr. Rahnema's own statement: "I do not feel comfortable sending patient back to jail";
     b. Four presentations in 72 hours;
     c. Two documented suicide attempts after prior discharges;
     d. Positive Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale screenings;
     e. Express statements of suicidal intent;
     f. Plaintiff being off court-ordered medications;
     g. Journey's refusal to evaluate (putting Meriter on notice that crisis services were inadequate);
     h. Lost social work documentation;
     i. Meriter's own 15-year history with Plaintiff's psychiatric emergencies;
     j. Meriter's own ASA 3 classification of Plaintiff on September 3, 2025, documenting severe systemic disease.

347. Meriter and Dr. Rahnema drew the inference that substantial risk existed.

348. Dr. Rahnema's statement "I do not feel comfortable" proves he drew the inference of substantial risk.

349. Despite this knowledge, Meriter and Dr. Rahnema consciously disregarded the risk by:
     a. Discharging Plaintiff four times in 72 hours despite ongoing suicidal ideation;
     b. Discharging after first suicide attempt without ensuring adequate psychiatric stabilization;
     c. Discharging after second suicide attempt without ensuring adequate psychiatric stabilization;
     d. Dr. Rahnema discharging despite his own documented discomfort with the decision;
     e. Failing to arrange alternative psychiatric evaluation when Journey refused;
     f. Failing to arrange medication restart despite knowing Plaintiff was off court-ordered medications;
     g. Failing to arrange inpatient psychiatric admission through alternative means;
     h. Deferring to Journey's refusal to evaluate without independent clinical judgment;
     i. Discharging to same dangerous jail conditions where suicide attempts had already occurred;
     j. Providing only minimal discharge instructions inadequate for acute suicidal crisis.

350. Meriter's pattern of discharges despite high suicide risk extends back to at least January 2020.

351. Meriter's March 2021 discharge documentation proves institutional policy of discharging despite ongoing suicidal ideation based on personality disorder diagnosis.

352. This institutional policy satisfies Monell requirements for municipal liability.

353. Meriter's actions were objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.

354. Dr. Rahnema's individual actions were objectively unreasonable and violated clearly established law.

355. Dr. Rahnema knew or should have known that discharging a patient he was "not comfortable" discharging violated constitutional rights.

356. As a direct and proximate result of Meriter's and Dr. Rahnema's deliberate indifference, Plaintiff suffered:
     a. Three suicide attempts;
     b. Multiple self-inflicted lacerations requiring sutures;
     c. Physical pain and scarring;
     d. Severe emotional distress;
     e. Prolonged psychiatric crisis;
     f. Violation of constitutional rights.

357. Meriter's and Dr. Rahnema's actions were willful, wanton, and in reckless disregard of Plaintiff's constitutional rights, warranting punitive damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Meriter Hospital, Inc. and Sami Rahnema, M.D. for:
     a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;
     b. Punitive damages;
     c. Costs and attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988;
     d. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT III
42 U.S.C. § 1983 - Fourteenth Amendment Deliberate Indifference
Against Dane County and Wellpath Healthcare Corporation

358. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

359. Plaintiff had a clearly established constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment to adequate medical and psychiatric care while in custody at Dane County Jail.

360. Dane County and Wellpath were responsible for providing constitutionally adequate healthcare at the jail.

361. Wellpath acted as Dane County's agent in providing healthcare services.

362. Dane County is responsible for Wellpath's constitutional violations.

363. Plaintiff's serious mental illnesses constituted serious medical needs requiring psychiatric medications and mental health monitoring.

364. Dane County and Wellpath were aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that substantial risk of serious harm existed.

365. Specifically, Dane County and Wellpath had actual knowledge through:
     a. Plaintiff's Chapter 51 commitment requiring psychiatric treatment;
     b. Court order requiring four specific psychiatric medications;
     c. Plaintiff's placement on suicide observation status;
     d. Plaintiff's three suicide attempts in jail;
     e. Plaintiff's returns from hospital emergency department with sutures and documented suicidal ideation;
     f. Plaintiff's express threats of suicide to jail staff;
     g. Wellpath contract provisions requiring medications for mental illness "shall not be delayed."

366. Dane County and Wellpath drew the inference that substantial risk existed.

367. Despite this knowledge, Dane County and Wellpath consciously disregarded the risk by:
     a. Denying court-ordered psychiatric medications in November 2024;
     b. Failing to provide mental health evaluation within 24-72 hours as required by contract;
     c. Maintaining Plaintiff on suicide observation without adequate monitoring;
     d. Failing to prevent three suicide attempts despite suicide observation status;
     e. Dismissing and ignoring Plaintiff's threats of suicide;
     f. Returning Plaintiff to same cell after each suicide attempt without additional safety measures;
     g. Failing to arrange psychiatric hospitalization after suicide attempts;
     h. Failing to coordinate with Meriter to ensure medication restart and psychiatric stabilization.

368. Wellpath's denial of medications violated express contract provisions requiring medications for mental illness "shall not be delayed upon admission."

369. This contractual violation also constitutes constitutional violation because it denied adequate medical care.

370. Dane County's policies, customs, and practices regarding suicide prevention were inadequate and caused Plaintiff's harm.

371. Specifically, Dane County maintained inadequate policies regarding:
     a. Monitoring of inmates on suicide observation;
     b. Response to suicide threats and self-harm;
     c. Coordination with hospitals and crisis services;
     d. Implementation of court-ordered psychiatric treatment;
     e. Oversight of contract healthcare provider.

372. These inadequate policies satisfy Monell requirements for municipal liability.

373. As a direct and proximate result of Dane County's and Wellpath's deliberate indifference, Plaintiff suffered:
     a. Denial of court-ordered psychiatric medications;
     b. Medication withdrawal and psychiatric decompensation;
     c. Three suicide attempts in November 2024;
     d. Three suicide attempts in November 2025;
     e. Physical injuries requiring sutures;
     f. Severe emotional distress;
     g. Violation of constitutional rights.

374. Dane County's and Wellpath's actions were willful, wanton, and in reckless disregard of Plaintiff's constitutional rights, warranting punitive damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Dane County and Wellpath Healthcare Corporation for:
     a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;
     b. Punitive damages against Wellpath;
     c. Costs and attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988;
     d. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT IV
42 U.S.C. § 1983 - Monell Municipal Liability
Against Journey Mental Health, Inc., Meriter Hospital, Inc., and Dane County

375. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

376. Journey Mental Health, Meriter Hospital, and Dane County are "persons" subject to liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

377. Municipal liability under Monell v. Department of Social Services requires proof that constitutional violations resulted from: (a) official policy; (b) widespread custom or practice; or (c) deliberate indifference by final policymakers.

378. Journey Mental Health maintained official policies, customs, and practices that caused Plaintiff's constitutional injuries:
     a. Policy of refusing psychiatric evaluations for inmates based on behavioral judgments rather than medical necessity;
     b. Policy of refusing evaluations to avoid "rewarding behaviors";
     c. Custom of deferring to law enforcement custody rather than medical necessity;
     d. Practice of providing inadequate crisis assessments (7-minute phone calls) without file review or comprehensive screening;
     e. Practice of employing crisis workers like "George" despite knowledge of "old school" and "stern" approach inconsistent with trauma-informed care.

379. These Journey policies and customs are proven by:
     a. Consistent refusal to evaluate across November 1, 2025, November 2, 2025 (twice), and November 27, 2025 incidents;
     b. Express statement of not wanting to "reward behaviors";
     c. Heidi's characterization of George as "old school" and "stern" proving institutional awareness;
     d. Pattern spanning from 2001-2002 through November 2025;
     e. Involvement in similar violations in Thomas case (2023).

380. Meriter Hospital maintained official policies, customs, and practices that caused Plaintiff's constitutional injuries:

     c. Policy of assuming hospitalization is unhelpful for patients with personality disorders;
     d. Custom of deferring to Journey's refusal to evaluate without independent clinical judgment;
     e. Practice of discharging despite high Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores when patient has personality disorder diagnosis.

381. These Meriter policies and customs are proven by:
     a. March 2021 discharge documentation containing identical rationale to November 2025 discharges;
     b. Seven specific "rationales" in March 2021 discharge note establishing policy;
     c. Pattern of high-risk discharges from January 2020 through November 2025;
     d. Four discharges in 72 hours in November 2025 proving systematic pattern;
     e. Dr. Rahnema's discharge despite documented discomfort proving institutional pressure;
     f. Involvement in similar violations in 2008 case and 2001-2002 case.

382. Dane County maintained official policies, customs, and practices that caused Plaintiff's constitutional injuries:
     a. Inadequate suicide prevention policies;
     b. Inadequate monitoring of inmates on suicide observation;
     c. Inadequate response to suicide threats and attempts;
     d. Inadequate oversight of Wellpath contract compliance;
     e. Failure to implement court-ordered psychiatric treatment.

383. These Dane County policies and customs are proven by:
     a. Three suicide attempts occurring while on suicide observation status;
     b. Return to same cell after each attempt without additional safety measures;
     c. Wellpath's contract violations occurring without County intervention;
     d. Pattern spanning from 2001-2002 through November 2025;
     e. Involvement in similar violations in Thomas case (2023) and 2008 case.

384. Final policymakers at each entity were aware of constitutional violations and responded with deliberate indifference.

385. Journey's final policymakers were aware through:
     a. Journey's own June 2025 court filing predicting suicide risk;
     b. Repeated contacts from Meriter requesting evaluations;
     c. Three suicide attempts proving prior refusals were inadequate;
     d. Plaintiff's November 27, 2025 complaint about George;
     e. Heidi's acknowledgment of George's problematic approach.

386. Meriter's final policymakers were aware through:
     a. Pattern of presentations documented in medical records from 2020-2025;
     b. Dr. Rahnema's documented concern;
     c. Social work's lost documentation;
     d. Four presentations in 72 hours;
     e. Three suicide attempts after discharges.

387. Dane County's final policymakers were aware through:
     a. Three suicide attempts in November 2024;
     b. Three suicide attempts in November 2025;
     c. Wellpath contract compliance issues;
     d. Court orders requiring psychiatric treatment;
     e. Thomas lawsuit (2023) involving same defendants and similar violations.

388. Despite this awareness, final policymakers at each entity failed to: (a) investigate; (b) provide additional training; (c) modify policies; (d) discipline employees; (e) implement corrective measures.

389. This failure to act despite awareness constitutes deliberate indifference satisfying Monell liability.

390. The policies, customs, and practices were the moving force behind the constitutional violations.

391. But for these policies, customs, and practices, Plaintiff would not have suffered constitutional injuries.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Journey Mental Health, Inc., Meriter Hospital, Inc., and Dane County for:
     a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;
     b. Costs and attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988;
     c. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT V
EMTALA - Failure to Provide Appropriate Medical Screening Examination
42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a)
Against Meriter Hospital, Inc.

392. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

393. Meriter Hospital is a "hospital" as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e)(2) and participates in Medicare.

394. Meriter Hospital has an "emergency department" as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e)(2).

395. On November 1, 2025 (first visit), November 1-2, 2025 (second visit), November 2, 2025 at 1:20 a.m. (third visit), and November 2, 2025 evening (fourth visit), Plaintiff "came to the emergency department" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a).

396. At each visit, Plaintiff presented with symptoms of acute psychiatric emergency including suicidal ideation, recent suicide attempts, and self-inflicted injuries.

397. These symptoms created a reasonable person's belief that Plaintiff's health was in serious jeopardy, constituting a "request for examination or treatment for a medical condition" under 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a).

398. EMTALA required Meriter to provide an "appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department" to determine whether an "emergency medical condition" existed. 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a).

399. An "appropriate medical screening examination" for psychiatric emergency requires: (a) comprehensive suicide risk assessment using validated instruments; (b) evaluation by qualified mental health professional; (c) assessment of acute dangerousness; (d) determination of need for psychiatric hospitalization.

400. Meriter failed to provide appropriate medical screening examination at each of the four visits.

401. Specifically, Meriter's screening was inadequate because:
     a. Meriter deferred to Journey's refusal to evaluate without conducting independent comprehensive psychiatric assessment;
     b. Meriter did not ensure evaluation by qualified mental health professional when Journey refused;
     c. Meriter did not arrange alternative psychiatric consultation;
     d. Meriter conducted only limited emergency department assessment insufficient for psychiatric emergency;
     e. Meriter's screening did not assess Plaintiff's ability to remain safe in jail environment;
     f. Meriter's screening did not address medication non-compliance;
     g. Meriter's screening after first and second suicide attempts did not adequately reassess dangerousness.

402. The inadequate screening resulted from Meriter's policy of deferring to Journey without independent clinical judgment.

403. Meriter treated Plaintiff differently than it would treat similarly situated patients without custody status or personality disorder diagnosis.

404. The inadequate screening violated 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a).

405. As a direct result of inadequate screening, Plaintiff suffered:
     a. Failure to identify need for psychiatric hospitalization;
     b. Unsafe discharges leading to three suicide attempts;
     c. Physical injuries;
     d. Emotional distress.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Meriter Hospital, Inc. for:
     a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;
     b. Costs and attorney's fees;
     c. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT VI
EMTALA - Failure to Stabilize Emergency Medical Condition (November 1, 2025)
42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b)
Against Meriter Hospital, Inc.

406. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

407. Plaintiff's presentation on November 1, 2025, at approximately 10:42 a.m., constituted an "emergency medical condition" as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e)(1).

408. Specifically, Plaintiff presented with acute psychiatric symptoms including suicidal ideation and recent suicide by cop attempt such that "the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in... serious impairment to bodily functions; or... serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part."

409. The substantial risk of suicide constituted serious impairment to bodily functions (death).

410. EMTALA required Meriter to "provide... such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition" before discharge. 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b)(1)(A).

411. "Stabilize" means "to provide such medical treatment of the condition as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual." 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e)(3)(A).

412. For psychiatric emergency, stabilization requires: (a) resolution of acute suicidal ideation or plan; (b) establishment of safety plan; (c) arrangement of appropriate follow-up care; (d) medication management; (e) ensuring patient can remain safe in discharge environment.

413. Meriter failed to stabilize Plaintiff's emergency medical condition before discharge on November 1, 2025.

414. Specifically, Meriter failed to:
     a. Resolve acute suicidal ideation;
     b. Arrange psychiatric hospitalization;
     c. Restart court-ordered psychiatric medications;
     d. Establish safety plan;
     e. Ensure Plaintiff could remain safe in jail environment;
     f. Arrange intensive psychiatric follow-up.

415. Meriter discharged Plaintiff while emergency medical condition persisted.

416. Plaintiff's suicide attempt hours after discharge proves material deterioration occurred.

417. Material deterioration after discharge proves Plaintiff was not stabilized before discharge.

418. The suicide attempt was reasonably foreseeable based on: (a) Journey's June 2025 prediction; (b) acute suicidal ideation at presentation; (c) suicide by cop attempt hours earlier; (d) denial of medications; (e) isolated jail environment.

419. Meriter's failure to stabilize violated 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b)(1).

420. As a direct result of failure to stabilize, Plaintiff suffered:
     a. Suicide Attempt #1;
     b. Self-inflicted lacerations;
     c. Physical pain;
     d. Emotional distress;
     e. Need for repeat emergency department visit.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Meriter Hospital, Inc. for:
     a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;
     b. Costs and attorney's fees;
     c. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT VII
EMTALA - Knowing and Willful Failure to Stabilize with False Certification
(November 2, 2025, 1:20 a.m. - 2:08 a.m.)
42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b) and (d)(1)(B)
Against Meriter Hospital, Inc. and Sami Rahnema, M.D.

421. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

422. Plaintiff's presentation on November 2, 2025, at approximately 1:20 a.m., following Suicide Attempt #1, constituted an emergency medical condition.

423. Dr. Rahnema personally examined Plaintiff from approximately 1:20 a.m. to 2:08 a.m.

424. Dr. Rahnema documented in Plaintiff's medical chart: "I do not feel comfortable sending patient back to jail."

425. This statement proves Dr. Rahnema's actual knowledge that Plaintiff was not stabilized.

426. Despite this documented knowledge, Dr. Rahnema discharged Plaintiff to jail.

427. By discharging Plaintiff, Dr. Rahnema implicitly certified that Plaintiff was stabilized.

428. This certification was false because Dr. Rahnema knew Plaintiff was not stabilized, as proven by his documented statement.

429. Dr. Rahnema's false certification while knowing Plaintiff was not stabilized constitutes "knowing and willful" violation of EMTALA. 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(1)(B).

430. A knowing and willful EMTALA violation subjects the physician to civil monetary penalties up to $119,942 per violation. 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. § 1003.103(a); 89 Fed. Reg. 41,638 (May 10, 2024).

431. Dr. Rahnema's knowing and willful violation also creates heightened liability for Meriter Hospital.

432. Meriter is liable for Dr. Rahnema's knowing and willful violation because Dr. Rahnema was acting within the scope of his employment or agency relationship with Meriter.

433. Plaintiff's Suicide Attempt #2 hours after discharge proves Dr. Rahnema's assessment was correct: Plaintiff was not stabilized and should not have been sent back to jail.

434. As a direct result of the knowing and willful failure to stabilize, Plaintiff suffered:
     a. Suicide Attempt #2;
     b. Additional self-inflicted lacerations;
     c. Physical pain;
     d. Emotional distress;
     e. Need for third emergency department visit.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Meriter Hospital, Inc. and Sami Rahnema, M.D. for:
     a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;
     b. Civil monetary penalties as authorized by law;
     c. Costs and attorney's fees;
     d. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT VIII
EMTALA - Pattern of Violations After Prior Citation
42 U.S.C. § 1395dd
Against Meriter Hospital, Inc.

435. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

436. On February 17, 2023, Meriter Hospital received a citation or warning from CMS or state survey agency regarding EMTALA compliance.

437. Upon information and belief, this citation related to psychiatric emergency department treatment.

438. This citation put Meriter on notice of EMTALA compliance deficiencies.

439. Despite this prior citation, Meriter committed EMTALA violations during all four of Plaintiff's November 2025 emergency department visits.

440. The November 2025 violations occurred less than three years after the February 2023 citation.

441. This pattern of violations after citation proves:
     a. Meriter's systemic EMTALA compliance problems;
     b. Meriter's failure to implement corrective action after citation;
     c. Meriter's deliberate indifference to EMTALA requirements;
     d. Need for injunctive relief and enhanced monitoring.

442. Pattern violations after citation warrant enhanced damages and injunctive relief.

443. As a direct result of pattern violations, Plaintiff suffered all injuries previously described.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Meriter Hospital, Inc. for:
     a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;
     b. Enhanced civil monetary penalties based on pattern violations;
     c. Costs and attorney's fees;
     d. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT IX
Americans with Disabilities Act - Title II Discrimination
42 U.S.C. § 12132
Against Journey Mental Health, Inc. and Meriter Hospital, Inc.

444. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

445. Plaintiff's serious mental illnesses including Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and PTSD constitute disabilities within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).

446. These disabilities substantially limit one or more major life activities including brain function, thinking, concentrating, and interacting with others.

447. Journey Mental Health is a public entity receiving federal funding and is therefore subject to Title II of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12132.

448. Meriter Hospital is a public accommodation subject to Title III of the ADA, or alternatively receives federal funding making it subject to Title II.

449. Plaintiff was a qualified individual with a disability seeking services from Journey and Meriter for which he was otherwise eligible.

450. Journey and Meriter discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of disability by:
     a. Refusing to provide crisis psychiatric evaluation based on diagnosis of borderline personality disorder;
     b. Applying different standards of care to Plaintiff than to patients without personality disorder diagnosis;
     c. Characterizing help-seeking behavior as "secondary gain" based on personality disorder diagnosis;
     d. Assuming hospitalization would be unhelpful based on diagnosis rather than individualized assessment;
     e. Discharging despite ongoing suicidal ideation based on assumptions about personality disorders;
     f. Stating refusal to "reward behaviors" - a punitive approach applied to personality disorder but not other mental illnesses.

451. Journey and Meriter would not have refused evaluation, characterized help-seeking as manipulative, or discharged despite suicidal ideation if Plaintiff had a different psychiatric diagnosis without the stigma associated with personality disorders.

452. Journey and Meriter's policies and practices have a disparate impact on individuals with personality disorders.

453. Journey and Meriter failed to make reasonable modifications to policies and practices to avoid discrimination.

454. Reasonable modifications would include: (a) individualized assessment rather than diagnosis-based assumptions; (b) same evaluation standards regardless of diagnosis; (c) trauma-informed crisis intervention rather than punitive approach.

455. As a direct result of discrimination, Plaintiff suffered:
     a. Denial of crisis psychiatric services;
     b. Unsafe discharges;
     c. Three suicide attempts;
     d. Physical injuries;
     e. Emotional distress;
     f. Violation of civil rights.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Journey Mental Health, Inc. and Meriter Hospital, Inc. for:
     a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;
     b. Costs and attorney's fees;
     c. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT X
Rehabilitation Act - Section 504 Discrimination
29 U.S.C. § 794
Against Journey Mental Health, Inc. and Meriter Hospital, Inc.

456. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

457. Plaintiff is an individual with disabilities within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B).

458. Journey Mental Health and Meriter Hospital receive federal financial assistance including Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements.

459. Journey and Meriter are therefore subject to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).

460. Plaintiff was otherwise qualified to receive crisis services from Journey and emergency services from Meriter.

461. Journey and Meriter excluded Plaintiff from participation in services, denied him benefits, and subjected him to discrimination solely by reason of his disabilities.

462. The discrimination alleged in Count IX applies equally to this Rehabilitation Act claim.

463. Journey and Meriter's refusal to provide adequate services was based on disability-based stereotypes and assumptions about individuals with borderline personality disorder.

464. As a direct result of discrimination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiff suffered all damages previously described.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Journey Mental Health, Inc. and Meriter Hospital, Inc. for:
     a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;
     b. Costs and attorney's fees;
     c. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT XI
Breach of Contract
Against Wellpath Healthcare Corporation

465. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

466. Wellpath Healthcare Corporation entered into a contract with Dane County effective January 1, 2023, with a term through December 31, 2027, for total consideration of $38,732,469.
